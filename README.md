# üì∞[News Explorer Front End](https://news-explorer-site.netlify.app/)üì∞

## Project Description / Functionality: 
- This site is a news app which lets the user search for relevant news articles from the past week by keyword.
- Users can sign in, and scroll through cards displaying the article's basic information, and have the option of visiting the article's page, or saving articles to the "Saved Articles" page by clicking the bookmark icon on the article card. 
- Users can then view their "Saved Articles" page whenever they return to the site. User info is saved in localStorage, so there is no need to sign in on every visit.
